# challenge-project-11

## Description

The job of this challenge project was to create a note taking application similar to Apple's Notepad. This would be used fr writing down anything you may need to remember, save it and be able to delete it if necessary. 

## Usage

The best way to use this application is to type what you want in your note and click "save" to save it or "delete" to delete it.

## Instructions

For this application, both Express.js and the inquirer package on node were used. Both must be downloaded to use this application via backend. Type "npm install -i" in your integrated terminal in your code editor. From there, type "node server.js" in your integrated terminal.
